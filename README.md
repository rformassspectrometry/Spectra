The *Spectra* package defines an efficient infrastructure for storing and
handling mass spectrometry spectra and functionality to subset, process,
visualize and compare spectra data.

A description of its functionality and design is available in this
[preprint](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/cwt2v_v2).

*Spectra* provides different implementations (backends) to store mass
spectrometry data. These comprise backends tuned for fast data access and
processing and backends for very large data sets ensuring a small memory
footprint.

A (possibly incomplete) list of available backends (along with a link to the R
package providing it) is shown below:

- `MsBackendCompDb` (package
  [*CompoundDb*](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/CompoundDb): provides
  access to spectra data (spectra and peaks variables) from a *CompDb*
  database. Has a small memory footprint because all data (except precursor m/z
  values) are retrieved on-the-fly from the database.

- `MsBackendDataFrame` (package: *Spectra*): alternative to the
  `MsBackendMemory` also keeping all data in memory, but supporting `S4` objects
  as spectra variables because the data is stored internally in a `DataFrame`.

- `MsBackendHdf5Peaks` (package: *Spectra*): on-disk backend similar to
  `MsBackendMzR`, but the peaks data is stored in HDF5 files (general spectra
  variables are kept in memory).

- `MsBackendHmdbXml` (package
  [*MsbackendHmdb*](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/MsBackendHmdb)):
  allows import of MS data from xml files of the Human Metabolome Database
  (HMDB). Extends the `MsBackendDataFrame` and keeps thus all data, after
  import, in memory.

- `MsBackendMassbank` (package
  [*MsBackendMassbank*](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/MsBackendMassbank)):
  allows to import/export data in MassBank text file format. Extends the
  `MsBackendDataFrame` and keeps thus all data, after import, in memory.

- `MsBackendMassbankSql` (package
  [*MsBackendMassbank*](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/MsBackendMassbank)):
  allows to directly connect to a MassBank SQL database to retrieve all MS data
  and variables. Has a minimal memory footprint because all data is retrieved
  on-the-fly from the SQL database.

- `MsBackendMemory` (package: *Spectra*): *default* backend which keeps all data
  in memory. Optimized for fast processing.

- `MsBackendMetaboLights` (package
  [*MsBackendMetaboLights*](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/MsBackendMetaboLights)):
  retrieves and caches MS data files from MetaboLights.

- `MsBackendMgf` (package
  [*MsBackendMgf*](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/MsBackendMgf)): allows
  to import/export data in mascot generic format (MGF). Extends the
  `MsBackendDataFrame` and keeps thus all data, after import, in memory.

- `MsBackendMsp` (package
  [*MsbackendMsp*](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/MsBackendMsp)): allows
  to import/export data in NIST MSP format. Extends the `MsBackendDataFrame` and
  keeps thus all data, after import, in memory.

- `MsBackendMzR` (package: *Spectra*): by using the `mzR` package it supports
  import of MS data from mzML, mzXML and CDF files. This backend keeps only
  general spectra variables in memory and retrieves the peaks data (m/z and
  intensity values) on-the-fly from the original data files. The backend has
  thus a smaller memory footprint compared to in-memory backends.

- `MsBackendOfflineSql` (package
  [*MsBackendSql*](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/MsBackendSql)):
  stores all MS data in a SQL database and has thus a minimal memory footprint.
  Does, in contrast to `MsBackendSql`, not keep an active SQL database
  connection and can thus support parallel processing.

- `MsBackendRawFileReader` (package
  [*MsBackendRawFileReader*](https://github.com/fgcz/MsBackendRawFileReader)):
  implements a backend for reading MS data from Thermo Fisher Scientific's raw
  data files using the manufacturer's NewRawFileReader .Net libraries. The
  package generalizes the functionality introduced by the `rawrr` package.

- `MsBackendSql` (package
  [*MsBackendSql*](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/MsBackendSql)):
  stores all MS data in a SQL database and has thus a minimal memory footprint.

- `MsBackendTimsTof` (package
  [*MsBackendTimsTof*](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/MsBackendTimsTof):
  allows import of data from Bruker TimsTOF raw data files (using the
  `opentimsr` R package).

- `MsBackendWeizMass` (package
  [*MsBackendWeizMass*](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/MsBackendWeizMass):
  allows to access MS data from WeizMass MS/MS spectral databases.
