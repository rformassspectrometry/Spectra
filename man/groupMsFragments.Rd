\title{Create Fragment Indexes by MS Level from Spectra}
\usage{
groupMsFragments(object, BPPARAM = SerialParam())
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{Spectra} object (from the Spectra package) containing MS
data. Must include at least two MS levels (\code{msLevel}) and be
ordered by \code{acquisitionNum} within each \code{dataOrigin}.}

\item{BPPARAM}{A \code{BiocParallelParam} object for parallel execution.
Defaults to \code{SerialParam()}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of indices, the vector will be of same length as
the input \code{Spectra} object. Each number indicates the group
associated with each spectrum (MS1 or MSn). Spectra from different
\code{dataOrigin} entries are grouped independently.
}
\description{
This function generates a \code{numeric} index grouping MSn (MS level > 1)
spectra with their corresponding MS1 spectra based on acquisition order.
It splits the input \code{Spectra} object by \code{dataOrigin}, verifies acquisition
order, and creates numeric group identifiers. MS1-only chunks are assigned
sequential IDs.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Each file/\code{dataOrigin} group must contain at least one MS1 spectrum.
\item If a group contains only MS1 spectra, each is assigned a unique group ID.
\item The user is responsible for ensuring that spectra are correctly ordered
within each file. Improper ordering may lead to incorrect groupings.
